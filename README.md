## What this?
This repo measures coding language in the specified git repository per a commit.

## Why I create this?
When I was a university student, I had to analyze around 5k repositories to check
what languages were used. I used [the fork of ohcount] at that time,
and as my training of ruby language, I tried to re-code a part of my code into ruby
language.

Not only "just-recoding", I changed the analyzer from [the fork of ohcount]
to [linguist] provided by [github].

[linguist]: https://github.com/github/linguist
[github]: https://github.com/github
